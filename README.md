# iBURST: Integrating Bulk RNA-Seq Data and Spatial Transcriptomics

The model consists of two part: 1) Spatial domain identification of spatial transcriptomics(ST) on multi-sample and 2) bulk RNA-seq deconvolution

![iBURST](figure/flowchart.pdf)

## Spatial Domain Identification for Multi-sample
The code for the first part is in folder code/mIMPACT. Clone the whold repo and run codes in

``` 
main.R
```

```{r}

```

## Bulk RNA-seq Deconvolution
The code for the second part is in folder code/bulk decov.

```
main_2.R
```
